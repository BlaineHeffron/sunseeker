Bifacial solar panels have cells on both sides. The front works like any panel. The back picks up light that bounces off the ground.

This sounds like free energy, and partly it is. But how much extra you get depends on what's under the panels and how high they sit. Most of the angle calculators out there ignore this.

## The ground matters

The surface beneath your panels reflects light. Some surfaces reflect more than others.

Snow reflects a lot. Fresh snow can bounce back 80-90% of the light that hits it. If you live somewhere with reliable winter snow, your bifacial panels will do well in those months.

White gravel or crushed stone reflects decently, around 60-70%. This is probably the most practical option if you're installing ground-mounted panels and want to boost rear-side capture. It costs a few dollars per square foot and doesn't blow away.

Grass reflects maybe 15-25%. Dark soil and asphalt reflect almost nothing.

So: if you're putting bifacial panels over your lawn, the "bifacial" part isn't doing much. You're mostly paying extra for cells you won't use.

## Height matters too

The back of the panel needs to "see" the reflective ground. If the panel sits two inches off the roof, reflected light can't reach the rear cells at a useful angle.

Most sources suggest at least 1 meter (about 3 feet) of clearance. Higher than that and you get diminishing returns plus structural complications.

Ground-mount systems naturally have this clearance. Rooftop installations usually don't, which is why bifacial panels make more sense for ground mounts.

## Angle is less different than you'd expect

Here's the thing that surprised me: bifacial panels don't need radically different tilt angles. The tilt math is mostly about the front side, which works the same as any panel.

What matters more is:
- Having a reflective surface below
- Having enough height for rear capture
- Maybe considering vertical mounting in specific situations

## When vertical makes sense

There's a case for mounting bifacial panels vertically (90°), facing east-west instead of toward the equator.

Vertical panels:
- Produce peaks in morning and evening (when many homes actually use power)
- Don't collect dust or snow
- Work well if the ground below is reflective

The tradeoff is lower total daily output compared to optimally tilted panels. But if your electricity rates are higher in morning/evening, or if you're in a dusty or snowy location, vertical can work out.

This mostly applies to lower latitudes (closer to the equator). At high latitudes, the sun sits low enough that vertical panels lose too much winter production.

## Is bifacial worth the cost?

Bifacial panels cost more. The premium varies, but figure 5-15% extra compared to similar monofacial panels.

Whether that's worth it depends on your setup:

**Probably worth it:**
- Ground mount over white gravel or light concrete
- Snowy climate with good winter sun
- You're already planning elevated mounting

**Probably not worth it:**
- Rooftop with minimal clearance
- Grass or dark ground beneath
- You're trying to minimize upfront cost

## What SunSeeker does for bifacial

The app has a bifacial mode. When you turn it on:
- The angle calculations adjust slightly (bifacial panels at high latitudes benefit from steeper angles)
- You see a ground reflectivity guide
- You get recommendations for panel height

It's not magic. It's just the right math for dual-sided panels, which most calculators don't bother with.

## The honest summary

Bifacial panels can produce more power. But "can" depends on your installation. If you're ground-mounting over a light-colored surface with good clearance, they're probably worth the premium. If you're roof-mounting with minimal clearance over dark shingles, you're paying for capability you won't use.

The app helps you figure out which situation you're in.
