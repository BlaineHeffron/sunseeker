Bifacial solar panels have cells on both sides. The front works like any panel. The back picks up light that bounces off the ground, nearby walls, and other surfaces.

This sounds like free energy, and partly it is. Depending on the installation, the rear side can add 5-30% more energy, according to research published in Energies (MDPI, 2025). But most of the articles you'll read about bifacial panels focus on the technology and skip the part that actually determines whether you'll see those gains: what's under the panels and how high they sit.

Most angle calculators and solar tools ignore bifacial entirely. That's what pushed us to build bifacial support into SunSeeker. The math is different for dual-sided panels, and getting it wrong means paying a premium for cells you won't use.

## The ground surface makes or breaks your bifacial investment

The rear cells need reflected light. How much they get depends almost entirely on what's below.

**Snow** is the best natural reflector. Fresh snow bounces back 80-90% of incoming light. If you live somewhere with reliable winter snow cover, your bifacial panels will have their best rear-side production in those months. A yearlong study of bifacial panels in Canada, published in EPJ Photovoltaics (2024), confirmed substantial winter gains in snowy conditions.

**White gravel or crushed stone** reflects roughly 60-70% of light. This is the most practical permanent solution for ground-mounted bifacial arrays. A layer of white stone costs a few dollars per square foot, doesn't blow away, and provides consistent rear-side illumination year round. Some installers now recommend white gravel as standard practice for bifacial ground mounts.

**Light-colored concrete** reflects around 40-50%. If you're mounting panels over a concrete pad or light-colored patio, bifacial makes sense without any ground modification.

**Grass** reflects 15-25%. Decent, but not great. The green absorbs most of the light that hits it.

**Dark soil, asphalt, and dark shingles** reflect almost nothing, maybe 5-10%. This is the trap many rooftop bifacial installations fall into. If your panels sit two inches above dark shingles, the "bifacial" part of the panel is contributing close to zero.

Research from MDPI's Energies journal (2025) found that high-reflectivity surfaces like aluminum and fresh snow increased rear-side yield by over 20%, while low-albedo surfaces limited gains to around 6%.

## Height determines how much of that reflection reaches the cells

Even over bright white gravel, the rear cells need clearance. If the panel sits flat against a surface, reflected light can't reach the back at a useful angle.

**Minimum: 1 meter (about 3 feet) of clearance.** This is the threshold most research agrees on. Below this, rear-side gains drop sharply.

**Optimal: 1.5-2 meters.** Gives the reflected light more area to reach the rear cells. Higher than 2 meters provides diminishing returns and creates structural challenges in wind.

Ground-mount systems naturally have this clearance. The panel edges are typically 1-2 meters off the ground by design. This is why bifacial panels make the most practical sense for ground-mounted installations.

Rooftop installations usually have 2-6 inches of clearance between panels and shingles. That's nowhere near enough for meaningful rear-side capture. Some commercial flat-roof systems use elevated racking to create clearance, but this adds cost and wind load.

**The honest take:** if you're roof-mounting with standard racking over dark shingles, bifacial panels will perform almost identically to monofacial panels. You're paying 5-15% more for cells that aren't doing anything.

## Tilt angle: less different than you'd expect

Here's what surprised me when I dug into the research: bifacial panels don't need radically different tilt angles from monofacial ones. The tilt math is mostly about the front side, which works the same regardless.

What does change slightly:

- At high latitudes, bifacial panels benefit from a steeper tilt (5-10 degrees more than latitude), which exposes more rear-cell area to ground reflection while the front side still captures the low winter sun well
- The optimal angle depends more on what's behind and below than on the front-side geometry
- If your ground surface has high albedo, the rear contribution is less sensitive to exact tilt

The SunSeeker app accounts for these differences in its bifacial mode. The adjustments are subtle but they compound over a year.

## When vertical mounting makes sense

There's a genuinely interesting case for mounting bifacial panels vertically (90 degrees), facing east-west instead of toward the equator. This sounds radical, but it works in specific situations.

**Vertical panels produce twin peaks.** One in the morning (east-facing side), one in the evening (west-facing side). This aligns with when many homes actually use the most electricity: before and after work.

**They don't collect dust or snow.** In dusty or snowy climates, this self-cleaning property can offset the lower total daily output. A study from Nature Scientific Reports (2024) on vertical bifacial panels in the UK found that while total annual yield was lower than optimally tilted panels, the production profile better matched demand patterns.

**The tradeoff:** lower total daily output compared to optimally tilted panels. Vertical bifacial typically produces 70-85% of the annual energy of the same panel at optimal tilt. Whether that works for you depends on your electricity rate structure. If peak rates are 3-4x off-peak rates, the time-shifted production from vertical panels can actually be worth more per kWh.

This mostly applies to lower latitudes (closer to the equator). At high latitudes, the winter sun sits so low that vertical east-west panels lose too much cold-season production to be practical.

## Is the bifacial premium worth it?

Bifacial panels cost 5-15% more than comparable monofacial panels. The bifacial market is growing fast, with global market share expected to reach 50% by 2026, according to industry projections. That scale is driving prices down.

**Probably worth it if:**
- Ground mount over white gravel, light concrete, or snowy ground
- You're already planning elevated mounting with 1+ meter clearance
- Your location has good winter sun and reliable snow cover
- You want higher energy density from the same footprint

**Probably not worth it if:**
- Standard rooftop installation with minimal clearance
- Dark ground surface (grass, dirt, dark shingles)
- You're minimizing upfront cost and every dollar matters
- Your roof faces east or west (front-side losses matter more than rear-side gains)

A rough guide: if your installation can realistically capture 10% or more rear-side gain, bifacial pays for its premium within 3-5 years. If rear-side gain is under 5%, you're better off spending the premium on an extra monofacial panel instead.

## What SunSeeker does for bifacial installations

The app has a dedicated bifacial mode. When you enable it:

- Angle calculations adjust for rear-side capture at your latitude
- A ground reflectivity guide shows you what different surfaces contribute
- You get height recommendations for optimal clearance
- The expected production estimate includes rear-side energy based on your ground surface

No other solar calculator does this. Most tools assume single-sided panels. If you're installing bifacial panels without accounting for albedo and height, you're guessing at a variable that determines whether your extra investment pays off or not.
