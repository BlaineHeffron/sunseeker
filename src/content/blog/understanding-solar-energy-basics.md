Last summer, a friend called me from his roof. He'd just installed a 6 kW solar system and wanted to know why his panels were producing less power at 2 PM on a 95-degree day than they had at 10 AM when it was cooler. "I thought more sun meant more power," he said.

He wasn't wrong, exactly. But the relationship between sunlight and electricity isn't as straightforward as it sounds. Understanding how solar panels actually work helps you make better decisions about everything from panel selection to placement to maintenance.

Here's what's really happening on your roof.

## The photovoltaic effect: sunlight becomes electricity

Every solar panel relies on the photovoltaic (PV) effect, a process first observed in 1839 by French physicist Edmond Becquerel. The basic mechanism hasn't changed since, though the materials have gotten far better.

Here's the sequence:

1. **Photons arrive.** Sunlight is made up of photons, tiny packets of energy. When they hit a solar cell, some pass through, some reflect, and some get absorbed.
2. **Electrons break free.** The absorbed photons transfer energy to electrons in the silicon, knocking them loose from their atoms.
3. **Current flows.** The cell is built with two layers of silicon, one with extra electrons (n-type) and one with missing electrons (p-type). This creates an electric field that pushes the freed electrons in one direction, generating direct current (DC).
4. **Metal contacts collect the current.** Thin metal lines on the cell's surface capture the flowing electrons and route them to wiring.

That's the core of it. One solar cell produces about 0.5 volts. Wire 60-72 cells together in a panel and you get a useful voltage.

Solar panel efficiency has improved steadily. Current panels convert between 20% and 25% of the sunlight hitting them into electricity, according to the National Renewable Energy Laboratory. The best commercial residential panels, like Aiko Solar's NEOSTAR 3P54 series, reach 25.0% module efficiency. In the lab, researchers at Fraunhofer ISE have pushed tandem solar modules to 34.2% efficiency, a world record set in early 2026.

## What's inside a solar panel

A solar panel is more engineered than it looks. Each component serves a specific purpose.

**Silicon cells** do the actual energy conversion. Most residential panels today use monocrystalline silicon, which delivers 20-24% efficiency and typically appears black. Polycrystalline panels (the blue ones) are less common now. They top out around 17-19% efficiency and cost less, but the price gap has narrowed enough that monocrystalline dominates the market.

**Tempered glass** on the front protects cells from hail, wind, and debris while letting 90-95% of light through.

**Anti-reflective coating** reduces the light that bounces off the glass. Without it, you'd lose about 30% of incoming photons to reflection.

**Encapsulant** (usually EVA film) seals the cells between the glass and backsheet, keeping moisture out. Moisture creeping into a panel corrodes connections and slowly degrades performance, which is why encapsulant quality matters more than most buyers realize.

**Backsheet** provides electrical insulation and weather protection on the rear side. Bifacial panels replace this with a second glass layer to capture reflected light from the ground.

**Aluminum frame** gives structural support and mounting points. It also grounds the panel electrically.

## How inverters turn DC into usable power

Solar panels produce direct current. Your home runs on alternating current. An inverter bridges that gap.

There are three common setups:

**String inverters** connect all your panels in a series and convert the combined DC output to AC in one central box. They're the most affordable option. The downside: if one panel underperforms (from shade, dirt, or a defect), it drags down the entire string.

**Microinverters** mount on each individual panel and convert DC to AC right at the source. They cost more but let each panel operate independently. If you have partial shading or panels facing different directions, microinverters usually make sense.

**Power optimizers** are a middle ground. They pair with a central inverter but optimize each panel's output individually. SolarEdge popularized this approach.

For most residential systems, the choice comes down to roof complexity. Simple south-facing roof with no shade? A string inverter works fine. Complex roof with dormers, vents, and partial shade? Microinverters or optimizers pay for themselves in higher output.

## What affects how much power your panels produce

My friend's rooftop mystery had a simple answer: heat. But temperature is just one of several factors.

**Sunlight intensity** is the obvious one. A clear day in Phoenix delivers more energy than an overcast day in Seattle. Solar resource is measured in "peak sun hours," the number of hours per day with 1,000 W/m2 of sunlight. Phoenix averages about 6.5 peak sun hours. Seattle averages about 3.5.

**Temperature** works against you on hot days. Panel efficiency drops roughly 0.3-0.5% for every degree Celsius above 25C (77F). On a 40C day, that's a 5-7% efficiency loss. This is why my friend's panels performed better in the cooler morning. Panels in cool, sunny climates (think Colorado mountains) often outperform panels in hot deserts per peak sun hour.

**Panel angle** determines how directly sunlight hits the surface. Panels perpendicular to the sun's rays generate the most power. Since the sun's path changes with the seasons, the ideal angle changes too. A tilt equal to your latitude is a solid year-round starting point. SunSeeker calculates the exact angle for your location and current date.

**Shading** is disproportionately damaging. A homeowner in Portland named Sarah spent weeks optimizing her panel angles only to realize a neighbor's oak tree was shading two panels every afternoon. Removing the shade problem gained her more production than all the angle tweaking combined. Even a small shadow across one cell can reduce a panel's output by 30-80%, depending on the wiring configuration. Before worrying about angles, make sure your panels have unobstructed sun from 9 AM to 3 PM.

**Dirt and debris** cause gradual losses of 2-5% in most climates. Dusty or pollen-heavy areas can see losses up to 25% without regular cleaning.

**Panel age** matters, but less than people think. NREL research shows that modern monocrystalline panels made after 2000 degrade at about 0.4% per year, lower than the 1% figure many installers still quote. After 25 years, expect 87-90% of original output. Some panels from the 1980s are still producing power today.

## Types of solar systems

How you connect your panels to the grid (or don't) changes what you can do with them and how quickly they pay for themselves.

**Grid-tied systems** are the most common, accounting for roughly 90% of residential installations. Your panels feed power to your home first, and any excess goes to the grid. Many utilities offer net metering, paying you a credit for that exported electricity. The tradeoff: no grid, no power. When the grid goes down, your system shuts off for safety reasons.

**Hybrid systems** add a battery (like Tesla Powerwall or Enphase IQ) to a grid-tied setup. You get backup power during outages and can store excess solar for evening use. The battery adds $8,000-$15,000 to system cost but provides energy independence and, in some markets, lets you avoid expensive peak-rate electricity.

**Off-grid systems** operate completely independently. They require enough battery storage to cover cloudy days and nighttime usage. These are common for cabins, RVs, and remote locations. Costs are higher, and you need to be more careful about energy management, but you're free from utility bills entirely.

## How much power can you expect

A rough formula:

**Daily production = system wattage x peak sun hours x 0.75**

The 0.75 factor accounts for real-world losses: inverter conversion, wiring resistance, temperature, dirt, and other inefficiencies.

For a typical 6 kW residential system in a location with 5 peak sun hours:

6,000 W x 5 hours x 0.75 = 22,500 Wh = **22.5 kWh per day**

The average US household uses about 30 kWh per day, so a 6 kW system covers roughly 75% of electricity needs in a decent solar location. Bump that to an 8 kW system and you're close to 100%.

At current prices of roughly $2.56 per watt before incentives (according to NREL's 2025 Solar Industry Update), a 6 kW system costs around $15,360 before any tax credits or rebates. The Department of Energy estimates most homeowners save $20,000-$96,000 over 25 years, depending on local electricity rates and solar resource.

## Solar's scale and trajectory

Solar energy has moved well past the "alternative" label. In 2024, the world installed over 554 GW of new solar capacity, bringing the global total past 2.2 terawatts, according to the IEA. Solar now generates more than 10% of global electricity.

The technology keeps improving. Perovskite-silicon tandem cells, which stack two light-absorbing layers to capture more of the spectrum, have hit 34.85% efficiency in the lab (LONGi, April 2025). These tandem designs are expected to reach commercial production within the next few years, pushing residential panel efficiency past 30%.

For anyone considering solar now: the panels you install today will produce power for 25-30 years. The technology doesn't need to be perfect to be worth it. A 22% efficient panel installed this year will generate more value over its lifetime than a hypothetical 30% panel you wait five years for.

## Getting started with your installation

Before you spend a dollar, do two things:

1. **Check your site.** Walk outside at noon and look at your roof. Count the hours of unobstructed sun between 9 AM and 3 PM. If you have fewer than 4 hours of direct sun, solar may not make financial sense at your location. No amount of panel technology overcomes a bad site.

2. **Find your angle.** SunSeeker uses your phone's GPS and sensors to calculate the optimal panel tilt for your exact location. Point the camera at your panels (or proposed panel location) and see in real time whether your angle is right. The app also sends seasonal adjustment reminders if you have an adjustable mounting system. It's free to download, and you can check your site before talking to any installer.

The biggest gains in solar don't come from chasing the latest panel technology. They come from getting the basics right: good placement, correct angle, minimal shading, and clean panels. That's where most of the money is.
