Curious about how solar panels actually work? This guide breaks down the science of solar energy into easy-to-understand concepts.

## The Photovoltaic Effect

At the heart of every solar panel is the photovoltaic (PV) effect—the process of converting light into electricity.

Here's the simplified version:

1. **Sunlight hits the panel** - Photons (light particles) strike the solar cells
2. **Electrons get excited** - The photons transfer energy to electrons in the silicon
3. **Electrons flow** - This creates an electrical current
4. **Current is captured** - Metal contacts collect the flowing electrons

## What's Inside a Solar Panel?

A typical solar panel consists of:

### Silicon Cells
The workhorses of solar energy. Most panels use either:
- **Monocrystalline** - Higher efficiency (18-22%), made from single crystal silicon, typically black
- **Polycrystalline** - Slightly lower efficiency (15-17%), made from multiple crystals, typically blue

### Glass Cover
Tempered glass protects the cells from weather while allowing maximum light through.

### Anti-Reflective Coating
Reduces light reflection so more photons reach the cells.

### Backsheet
Protects the back of the panel and provides electrical insulation.

### Frame
Usually aluminum, provides structural support and mounting points.

## Key Terms Explained

### Wattage (W)
The power output of a panel under ideal conditions. A 400W panel produces 400 watts at peak performance.

### Efficiency
The percentage of sunlight converted to electricity. Current consumer panels range from 15-22%.

### Kilowatt-hour (kWh)
The unit of energy your utility bills you for. A 400W panel producing for 5 hours generates 2 kWh.

### Peak Sun Hours
Hours per day when sunlight intensity equals 1,000 W/m². Varies by location (3-7 hours typically).

## What Affects Solar Panel Output?

### 1. Sunlight Intensity
More sunlight = more power. Clear days produce more than cloudy days.

### 2. Panel Angle
Panels perpendicular to sunlight generate the most power. This is why angle optimization matters so much.

### 3. Temperature
Counterintuitively, panels work better when cool. Efficiency drops about 0.5% per degree above 25°C (77°F).

### 4. Shading
Even partial shade dramatically reduces output. One shaded cell can affect an entire string of panels.

### 5. Panel Age
Panels degrade slowly over time—about 0.5% per year. After 25 years, expect 87-90% of original output.

## Types of Solar Systems

### Grid-Tied
- Connected to utility grid
- Excess power sold back (net metering)
- No power during grid outages
- Most common and cost-effective

### Off-Grid
- Completely independent
- Requires battery storage
- Works during outages
- Higher cost, more maintenance

### Hybrid
- Grid connection plus battery backup
- Best of both worlds
- Power during outages
- Higher upfront cost

## How Much Energy Can You Generate?

A rough estimate for your location:

**Daily Production = Panel Wattage × Peak Sun Hours × 0.75**

The 0.75 accounts for real-world losses (dust, temperature, wiring).

**Example:**
- 10 × 400W panels = 4,000W (4kW) system
- 5 peak sun hours per day
- 4,000 × 5 × 0.75 = 15,000 Wh = **15 kWh/day**

## The Role of Inverters

Solar panels produce direct current (DC), but your home uses alternating current (AC). Inverters convert DC to AC.

Types include:
- **String inverters** - One inverter for all panels
- **Microinverters** - One per panel, better for shading
- **Power optimizers** - Hybrid approach

## Making the Most of Your Solar

Maximize your solar investment by:

1. **Optimizing panel angle** - Use SunSeeker to find the perfect tilt
2. **Minimizing shading** - Trim trees, avoid obstructions
3. **Keeping panels clean** - Dust reduces output
4. **Monitoring production** - Catch problems early
5. **Adjusting seasonally** - If your mount allows it

## Environmental Impact

A typical residential solar system (6kW) offsets approximately:
- 8 metric tons of CO2 per year
- Equivalent to planting 130 trees annually
- Or driving 18,000 fewer miles

Over a 25-year lifespan, that's 200 metric tons of CO2 avoided.
