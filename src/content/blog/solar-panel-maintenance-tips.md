A neighbor of mine installed solar panels three years ago and hasn't touched them since. Not a single cleaning, no inspections, nothing. His system still produces within 5% of its original output.

Another guy I know climbs on his roof every month with a squeegee. He's meticulous. His system also produces within 5% of its original output.

The difference in effort is massive. The difference in results is almost nothing.

Solar panels are genuinely low-maintenance equipment. They have no moving parts, they're sealed against weather, and they sit in the one place that gets regular rain. But "low maintenance" doesn't mean "zero maintenance," and the few things worth doing can save you real money over the life of your system.

Here's what actually matters and what you can safely ignore.

## How to clean solar panels

Cleaning is the maintenance task people ask about most, and it's also the one with the most contradictory advice online.

**The short answer:** clean your panels when they're visibly dirty. For most homeowners in moderate climates, that's once or twice a year. Dusty areas, near agriculture, or heavy pollen zones might need cleaning every 3-4 months. If you get regular rain, you might never need to clean them at all.

**The science:** dirty panels lose 2-5% efficiency in most environments, according to research published in Renewable Energy. In extreme cases (desert dust, heavy bird activity, industrial fallout), losses can reach 15-25%. But in the average suburban setting, rain handles most of the cleaning naturally.

**How to actually do it:**

1. Clean early morning or late evening, never in the midday heat. Hot glass plus cold water can cause micro-cracks from thermal shock. Panels at 150+ degrees on a summer afternoon are not the time.

2. Use a garden hose from the ground if you can reach. No pressure washer. The tempered glass can handle hail but not sustained high-pressure streams at close range.

3. For stubborn grime (bird droppings, tree sap, pollen crust), use a soft brush on an extension pole with a little dish soap mixed into a bucket of water. Nothing abrasive. No Windex, no vinegar, no rubbing alcohol. These can damage the anti-reflective coating.

4. Rinse thoroughly. Soap residue attracts more dust.

That's it. The entire process takes 20 minutes for a typical residential array if you stay on the ground. If reaching your panels means climbing a ladder onto a steep roof, consider whether a 3-5% efficiency gain is worth the fall risk. For many people, the honest answer is no.

## What to actually inspect (and how often)

Monthly visual checks from the ground take two minutes and can catch problems before they get expensive.

**Look for:**

- **Cracks or discoloration in the glass.** These can indicate cell damage or moisture intrusion. Small chips on the edge usually aren't urgent. A crack running across a cell is.

- **Hot spots.** These show up as brown or yellow discoloration on the cell surface. They happen when one cell in a string gets shaded or damaged and starts converting current to heat instead of passing it through. Left unchecked, hot spots can permanently damage a panel.

- **Loose wiring or connectors** visible from below. Squirrels love chewing solar cable. If you see exposed copper or chewed insulation, call an electrician before it becomes a fire hazard.

- **Mounting hardware.** Check that bolts are tight and there's no visible rust. Roof-mounted systems should have intact flashing around penetration points. Water stains on the ceiling below your panels are a bad sign.

**From your monitoring system:**

If you have a monitoring app (most modern inverters come with one), check it weekly. You're looking for:

- Any single panel producing much less than its neighbors (could be shade, damage, or a bad connection)
- Gradual decline beyond the expected 0.4% per year degradation
- Inverter error codes (most common: ground fault, arc fault, or grid frequency errors)

SunSeeker tracks expected versus actual production for your location. A sudden drop of more than 15% that isn't explained by weather means something needs attention.

## Critter problems are real

This sounds minor until it happens to you. A family in suburban Denver had squirrels nest under their rooftop panels. The squirrels chewed through two MC4 connectors and a section of conduit. The repair bill was $800, plus the system was partially down for three weeks while they waited for parts.

Birds are the other common offender. Pigeons especially love the sheltered space under panels. Their droppings cause hot spots, their nests block airflow, and they're persistent.

**Prevention is cheaper than repair:**

- Critter guards (wire mesh around the panel perimeter) cost $8-15 per panel installed and solve the problem permanently
- Bird spikes on the panel frame edges deter nesting
- Trimming overhanging branches removes the highway squirrels use to reach your roof

If you're in an area with active wildlife, critter guards at installation time are worth every dollar.

## The inverter is the weak link

Your panels will likely last 25-30 years. Your inverter probably won't.

String inverters typically last 10-15 years. Microinverters and power optimizers often come with 25-year warranties, but real-world failure rates are still being studied since the technology is newer.

**What to watch for:**

- Green status lights should be steady, not blinking or absent
- Error codes on the display (check your manual, or search the code online, as most are documented)
- Unusual noise (buzzing or clicking, which can indicate capacitor issues)
- Production drops that affect all panels equally (points to inverter rather than panel problems)

Plan to replace a string inverter at least once during your system's lifetime. Budget $1,500-3,000 for replacement, though prices have been dropping. If your string inverter dies and you're getting the replacement anyway, it's a good time to consider upgrading to microinverters, especially if shading has become an issue since your original installation.

## Tree management

Trees grow. It's obvious, but people forget. The oak that was 20 feet from your array when you installed it might be shading panels five years later.

Walk your property in June (when the sun is highest) and again in December (when it's lowest). Note any shadows that cross your panels between 9 AM and 3 PM. Even partial shade during those hours costs more output than most people realize, especially with string inverters where one shaded panel can drag down the whole string.

Trimming costs $200-500 per tree typically. The production gain pays for it within a year or two.

## When to call a professional

Handle cleaning, visual inspections, and tree management yourself. Call a professional for:

- **Electrical issues:** exposed wiring, burning smell, or scorch marks. Don't touch these.
- **Significant production drops** (more than 15%) that cleaning doesn't fix
- **Roof leak concerns** around panel mounting points
- **After major weather events:** hail, falling branches, or high winds that could have damaged panels or mounts
- **Every 5 years** for a thermal imaging scan. This catches hot spots and failing connections that aren't visible to the naked eye. Cost is typically $150-300.

## A realistic maintenance calendar

| Task | How often | Time | DIY? |
|------|-----------|------|------|
| Visual check from ground | Monthly | 2 min | Yes |
| Monitor production data | Weekly | 1 min | Yes |
| Clean panels | 1-2x per year | 20 min | Yes (if safe) |
| Check mounting hardware | Annually | 10 min | Yes |
| Trim encroaching trees | As needed | Varies | Usually hire out |
| Professional thermal scan | Every 5 years | 1 hour | No |
| Inverter replacement | Once (at ~12 years) | Half day | No |

Total DIY time per year: maybe 3 hours. That's it.

## What you can skip

- **Monthly roof climbs.** Not worth the risk for the marginal benefit.
- **Expensive cleaning products.** Water and a soft brush do the job.
- **Panel-level power measurements** unless your monitoring system flags a problem.
- **Worry.** These are simple devices. They sit in the sun and make electricity. If your production numbers look normal, everything is fine.

The panels themselves are the most reliable part of your solar system. NREL data shows modern mono panels degrade at about 0.4% per year. After 25 years, they're still producing nearly 90% of their original output. The rest of the system, inverters, wiring, mounting hardware, needs more attention. Focus your maintenance time there.
