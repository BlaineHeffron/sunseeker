Solar panels are remarkably low-maintenance, but a little care goes a long way. Here are 10 essential tips to keep your solar system running at maximum efficiency.

## 1. Regular Visual Inspections

Check your panels monthly for:
- Cracks or chips in the glass
- Discoloration or hot spots
- Bird droppings or debris buildup
- Loose mounting hardware
- Damaged wiring visible from ground level

## 2. Keep Panels Clean

Dust, pollen, bird droppings, and leaves can reduce efficiency by 5-25%. Clean your panels:

- **Frequency**: Every 6 months minimum, more in dusty areas
- **Method**: Spray with garden hose in early morning or evening
- **Avoid**: High-pressure washers, abrasive materials, cleaning in hot sun

### DIY Cleaning Solution
Mix a small amount of dish soap with water. Use a soft brush or squeegee on an extension pole.

## 3. Monitor Your Energy Production

Track your daily and monthly energy output. A sudden drop could indicate:
- Panel damage
- Inverter issues
- Shading from new tree growth
- Positioning problems

SunSeeker helps you track expected vs. actual production based on your location and weather.

## 4. Trim Nearby Trees

Trees grow! What was full sun last year might be partially shaded now. Regularly assess and trim vegetation that could cast shadows on your panels, especially during peak sun hours (10 AM - 2 PM).

## 5. Check for Critter Damage

Birds, squirrels, and other animals can:
- Nest under panels
- Chew through wiring
- Leave droppings that cause hot spots

Consider installing critter guards around your panel array.

## 6. Inspect Mounting and Racking

Ensure all mounting hardware is secure. Check for:
- Rust or corrosion
- Loose bolts
- Proper waterproofing around roof penetrations

## 7. Review Inverter Performance

Your inverter should display green lights and normal readings. Check it monthly and note any error codes. Most inverters have a 10-15 year lifespan—shorter than your panels.

## 8. Seasonal Angle Adjustments

If your system allows for manual adjustment, optimize your panel angle each season:

| Season | Action |
|--------|--------|
| Spring Equinox | Set to latitude angle |
| Summer Solstice | Reduce angle by 15° |
| Fall Equinox | Return to latitude angle |
| Winter Solstice | Increase angle by 15° |

Use SunSeeker to get precise angle recommendations for your location.

## 9. Snow Removal Strategy

For snowy climates:
- Let light snow melt naturally (panels generate heat)
- Use a soft roof rake for heavy accumulation
- Never use sharp tools or hot water
- Consider a steeper installation angle (40°+) for natural snow shedding

## 10. Schedule Professional Inspections

Have a professional inspect your system every 3-5 years for:
- Electrical connection integrity
- Inverter performance analysis
- Thermal imaging to detect hot spots
- Mounting system structural check

## Maintenance Schedule at a Glance

| Task | Frequency |
|------|-----------|
| Visual inspection | Monthly |
| Energy monitoring | Daily/Weekly |
| Panel cleaning | Every 6 months |
| Tree trimming | Annually |
| Professional inspection | Every 3-5 years |
| Angle adjustment | Seasonally (if adjustable) |

## When to Call a Professional

Contact a solar technician if you notice:
- Significant production drop (>15%)
- Visible damage to panels or wiring
- Inverter error codes that won't clear
- Burning smell or discoloration
- Roof leaks near panel mounts

## The Bottom Line

A well-maintained solar system can produce clean energy for 25-30 years. Most maintenance is simple and DIY-friendly. Regular attention to your panels ensures you're getting the maximum return on your solar investment.
