Your solar panels produce the most power when sunlight hits them straight on. The angle between your panel and the ground, called the tilt, determines how close to "straight on" you can get throughout the day and across seasons.

Get the tilt badly wrong and you can lose 10-30% of potential production, according to tilt angle research compiled by PVGIS. Get it roughly right and you capture most of what's available. The difference between "roughly right" and "perfectly optimized" is usually small enough that obsessing over it isn't productive.

Here's how to figure out the best angle for your solar panels without overcomplicating it.

## The latitude rule: your starting point

A solid general rule: set your tilt angle equal to your latitude.

This works because the sun's average position over a full year roughly corresponds to your latitude angle. At 40 degrees north (New York, Madrid, Denver), a 40-degree tilt catches the most total sunlight across all seasons.

Here are some reference points:

| City | Latitude | Year-round tilt |
|------|----------|----------------|
| Miami | 26 degrees | 26 degrees |
| Houston | 30 degrees | 30 degrees |
| Los Angeles | 34 degrees | 34 degrees |
| Denver | 40 degrees | 40 degrees |
| New York | 41 degrees | 41 degrees |
| Chicago | 42 degrees | 42 degrees |
| Seattle | 48 degrees | 48 degrees |
| Minneapolis | 45 degrees | 45 degrees |

This gives you a reasonable year-round average. Not perfect for any single day, but a good balance. If you have fixed-mount panels and can only set one angle, latitude is the answer. Don't overthink it.

## Seasonal adjustments: when they're worth it

The sun's path changes with seasons. In summer it climbs high, in winter it stays low. If you can change your panel angle, you can improve on the latitude rule.

**The simple formula:**
- Summer: latitude minus 15 degrees
- Winter: latitude plus 15 degrees
- Spring and fall: latitude

At 40 degrees latitude, that means:
- Summer: 25-degree tilt
- Winter: 55-degree tilt
- Spring/fall: 40-degree tilt

**A more precise formula** (from the research literature):
- Winter optimal = (latitude x 0.9) + 29 degrees
- Summer optimal = (latitude x 0.9) - 23.5 degrees

At 40 degrees latitude, the precise formula gives winter = 65 degrees and summer = 12.5 degrees. More aggressive than the simple formula, and slightly better if you're optimizing hard.

**How much do seasonal adjustments help?** Research from Energy Science & Engineering (Wiley, 2025) found that seasonal tilt changes can increase annual production by 8-9%. At higher latitudes, the gain is larger because the seasonal sun angle difference is more extreme. At lower latitudes (closer to the equator), the gain shrinks because the sun doesn't vary as much.

A panel fixed at the winter angle still captures 81-88% of the energy compared to full tracking, according to data from solarpaneltilt.com. That's remarkably good for a fixed, no-moving-parts setup.

**Is it worth the hassle?** Depends on your setup. If you have ground-mounted panels with adjustable brackets, it takes five minutes to change the angle. Do it four times a year and you gain 8-9% more annual production. That's real money.

If your panels are on a steep roof and adjusting means a ladder and 30 minutes of careful work, the math is less appealing. At $0.15/kWh, the seasonal gain on a 6 kW system might be worth $50-80 per year. Worth it to some people, not to others.

SunSeeker sends optional reminders around each equinox and solstice. If you want to adjust, the reminders help. If you don't, turn them off. You're not leaving huge amounts of energy on the table either way.

## Direction matters as much as tilt

Tilt gets all the attention, but direction (azimuth) is the other half of the equation.

**In the northern hemisphere, panels should face due south.** In the southern hemisphere, due north. This maximizes the hours of direct sunlight as the sun crosses the sky.

How bad is it if you can't face true south? Less bad than you'd think:

| Direction | Approximate loss vs. south |
|-----------|---------------------------|
| True south | 0% (baseline) |
| 15 degrees off south (SSW or SSE) | 1-2% |
| 30 degrees off south | 3-5% |
| Due east or due west | 15-20% |
| Due north | 30-40%+ |

So if your roof faces southwest instead of true south, you're losing maybe 3-5%. That's less than the loss from a bad tilt angle or a single shaded panel.

**An interesting exception:** in markets with time-of-use electricity pricing, west-facing panels can actually generate more value than south-facing ones. West-facing panels produce their peak output in the afternoon, when electricity prices are typically highest. If your utility charges 3x more for afternoon power than morning power, a west-facing array might earn more money despite producing fewer total kWh.

## Flat roof considerations

If your roof is flat or nearly flat, your panels are effectively at 0-degree tilt. Low-angle panels still produce power, but less than tilted ones, especially at higher latitudes.

**The production loss from a flat installation:**

| Latitude | Loss vs. optimal tilt |
|----------|-----------------------|
| 25 degrees | 5-8% |
| 35 degrees | 10-15% |
| 45 degrees | 15-25% |
| 55 degrees | 25-35% |

Above 35 degrees latitude, tilted racking on a flat roof usually pays for itself within 2-3 years through higher production. Below 25 degrees, the gain is small enough that the cost of racking may not be justified.

## Common mistakes

**Ignoring shade for the sake of angle.** A perfectly angled panel in partial shade produces less than a poorly angled panel in full sun. One shaded cell can reduce a string inverter's output by 30-80%. Always prioritize clear sun exposure over angle optimization. Check your site at different times of day and in different seasons before finalizing panel placement.

**Over-optimizing.** Being 2-3 degrees off the calculated optimum costs you less than 1% of annual production. That's within the noise of daily weather variation. Don't stress about precision beyond what your mounting hardware can reliably set.

**Forgetting about azimuth.** A panel facing 30 degrees west of south loses more output than a panel tilted 10 degrees off the optimal angle. If you can only fix one thing, get the direction right first.

**Ignoring the physical constraints.** Your roof has a pitch. It faces a direction. Unless you're building a custom racking system, your tilt and azimuth are largely dictated by your roof. The calculation tells you what's ideal; your roof tells you what's possible. Usually the gap between ideal and possible is small enough that solar still makes financial sense.

## Where SunSeeker helps

The app does the latitude calculation automatically using your phone's GPS. It also adjusts for the current date, so you get a seasonally appropriate angle recommendation rather than a static number.

The camera feature lets you point your phone at your panel and see visually whether you're close to the target angle. Easier than holding a protractor against a roof-mounted panel.

If you have bifacial panels, switch to bifacial mode. The angle calculation adjusts slightly for rear-side capture. Read the [bifacial guide](/blog/bifacial-solar-panel-guide) for details on how ground surface and height affect bifacial performance.

## The bottom line

For most people: set tilt equal to latitude, face the equator, and move on. If you have adjustable mounts and enjoy tinkering, seasonal adjustments add 8-9% annually. If you have bifacial panels, the [bifacial guide](/blog/bifacial-solar-panel-guide) covers the extra considerations.

The app makes the calculation easy. The hard part is usually physical: getting up there and adjusting the hardware.
