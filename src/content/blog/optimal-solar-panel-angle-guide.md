Getting the right angle for your solar panels can increase energy production by up to 25%. In this comprehensive guide, we'll walk you through everything you need to know about solar panel positioning.

## Why Panel Angle Matters

Solar panels generate the most electricity when sunlight hits them perpendicular to their surface. As the sun moves across the sky throughout the day and changes position with the seasons, the optimal angle for your panels changes too.

## The Basic Formula

For a fixed-tilt system, a good starting point is:

**Optimal Tilt Angle = Your Latitude**

For example, if you live at 40° latitude (like New York or Madrid), a 40° tilt angle is a reasonable year-round compromise.

## Seasonal Adjustments

If you can adjust your panels seasonally, here's what to aim for:

| Season | Angle Adjustment |
|--------|------------------|
| Summer | Latitude - 15° |
| Winter | Latitude + 15° |
| Spring/Fall | Latitude |

### Why Adjust Seasonally?

In summer, the sun is higher in the sky, so a flatter panel angle captures more direct sunlight. In winter, the sun sits lower on the horizon, requiring a steeper angle.

## Factors That Affect Optimal Angle

### 1. Your Location
The closer you are to the equator, the flatter your panels should be. Near the poles, steeper angles work better.

### 2. Your Energy Goals
- **Maximize annual production**: Use latitude as your angle
- **Maximize winter production**: Add 15° to latitude
- **Maximize summer production**: Subtract 15° from latitude

### 3. Roof Constraints
Sometimes your roof angle limits your options. Even a non-optimal angle will still generate significant power—you might lose only 5-10% compared to the ideal angle.

### 4. Snow and Weather
In snowy climates, a steeper angle (at least 40°) helps snow slide off naturally, preventing buildup that blocks sunlight.

## Using SunSeeker to Find Your Perfect Angle

The SunSeeker app takes the guesswork out of panel positioning:

1. **Automatic location detection** - No need to look up your latitude
2. **Real-time sun position** - See exactly where the sun is right now
3. **AR visualization** - Point your camera at your panels to see the optimal angle overlay
4. **Seasonal recommendations** - Get notifications when it's time to adjust

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Ignoring azimuth (direction)** - Panels should generally face true south in the Northern Hemisphere
2. **Not accounting for shading** - Even partial shade dramatically reduces output
3. **Setting and forgetting** - If you can adjust seasonally, you should
4. **Over-engineering** - Small angle differences (1-2°) won't significantly impact production

## Quick Reference by Latitude

| Latitude | Summer | Winter | Year-Round |
|----------|--------|--------|------------|
| 25° | 10° | 40° | 25° |
| 35° | 20° | 50° | 35° |
| 45° | 30° | 60° | 45° |
| 55° | 40° | 70° | 55° |

## Conclusion

Finding the optimal solar panel angle doesn't have to be complicated. Start with your latitude as a baseline, adjust seasonally if possible, and use tools like SunSeeker to fine-tune your setup. Even small improvements in positioning can add up to significant energy gains over the lifetime of your solar installation.
