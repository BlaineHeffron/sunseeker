Your solar panels produce the most power when sunlight hits them straight on. The angle between the panel and the ground—the tilt—determines how close to "straight on" you can get throughout the day.

The sun's path changes with seasons and latitude. So the "best" angle depends on where you are and what you're optimizing for.

## The simple rule

A decent starting point: set your tilt angle equal to your latitude.

Live at 40° north (New York, Madrid, Beijing)? Try 40° tilt. At 30° (Houston, Cairo)? Try 30°.

This gives you a reasonable year-round average. Not perfect for any single day, but not bad overall.

## Seasonal adjustments

If you can change your panel angle, you can do better than the latitude rule.

In summer, the sun climbs high. Flatter panels (less tilt) catch more light. In winter, the sun stays low. Steeper panels work better.

A rough guide:
- Summer: latitude minus 15°
- Winter: latitude plus 15°
- Spring and fall: latitude

At 40° latitude, that means:
- Summer: 25° tilt
- Winter: 55° tilt
- Spring/fall: 40° tilt

Is it worth the hassle of climbing up there four times a year? Depends on your setup. Adjustable mounts make it easier. Fixed mounts mean you're stuck with one angle, so pick something close to your latitude and don't worry about it.

## Direction matters too

Tilt is only half the equation. Direction (azimuth) is the other half.

In the northern hemisphere, panels should face south. In the southern hemisphere, north. This catches the most sun as it crosses the sky.

East-facing or west-facing panels still work, but you'll lose some output—maybe 10-20% depending on how far off true south/north you are.

## What about flat roofs?

If your roof is flat or nearly flat, you're already at 0° tilt. Low-angle panels still produce power, but less than tilted ones. At higher latitudes, the loss from a flat installation can be significant.

The common solution: put panels on tilted racks. This adds cost but usually pays off in higher production, especially if you're above 35° latitude.

## Where SunSeeker helps

The app does the latitude calculation automatically using your phone's GPS. It also adjusts for the current date, so you get a seasonally-appropriate angle.

If you can adjust your panels, the app will remind you at each equinox and solstice. If you can't adjust them, at least you'll know what you're leaving on the table.

The camera feature lets you point your phone at the panel and see visually whether you're close to the target angle. Easier than eyeballing it with a protractor.

## Common mistakes

**Ignoring shade.** A perfectly-angled panel that sits in shade half the day produces less than a poorly-angled panel in full sun. Look at your site before obsessing over angles.

**Over-optimizing.** Being 2-3° off from optimal costs you very little. Don't stress about precision you can't measure.

**Forgetting about azimuth.** Tilt gets all the attention, but a panel facing west instead of south loses more output than one that's 10° off the optimal tilt.

## The bottom line

For most people: set tilt equal to latitude, face the equator, and move on with your life. If you have adjustable mounts and enjoy tinkering, seasonal adjustments help. If you have bifacial panels, read the bifacial guide—there are extra considerations.

The app makes the calculation easy. The hard part is usually physical: getting up there and adjusting the hardware.
