Every December I get the same question from people who just installed solar: "My production dropped 40%. Is something broken?"

Nothing is broken. Winter is just harder on solar panels than most people expect. Shorter days, lower sun angles, cloud cover, and occasionally snow all cut into production. But "less" doesn't mean "none." A 6 kW system in Boston still produces about 12-15 kWh on a clear winter day. That's real power.

The question isn't whether your panels work in winter. It's whether there's anything you can do about the drop.

## Why winter production falls

Three things happen at once.

**Days get shorter.** In December at 40 degrees latitude, you get about 9 hours of daylight versus 15 in June. That alone cuts your potential production by 40%.

**The sun sits lower.** At the same latitude, the midwinter sun peaks around 26 degrees above the horizon. In midsummer, it's around 73 degrees. When sunlight hits a flat panel at a shallow angle, less energy gets absorbed and more bounces off.

**Weather gets worse.** More clouds, more precipitation, more hours of diffuse (scattered) light instead of direct beam. Your panels still produce with clouds, just less. Expect 10-25% of rated output on an overcast day versus 80-100% in full sun.

Here's the counterintuitive part: cold temperatures actually help. Solar cells are semiconductors, and they perform better when cool. A 25-degree day in January produces more per hour of sunlight than a 95-degree day in July, all else equal. Panel efficiency drops roughly 0.3-0.5% for every degree Celsius above 25C. On a summer scorcher, you might lose 5-8% to heat.

So winter's problem isn't the cold. It's the short days and low sun angle.

## Should you adjust your panel angle for winter?

This is the question I get asked most. The sun is lower, so a steeper tilt should catch more direct light. And it does.

The standard recommendation: add about 15 degrees to your latitude for winter. At 40 degrees latitude, that means a 55-degree winter tilt instead of the year-round 40 degrees.

Research from a 2025 study published in Energy Science & Engineering confirms that seasonal tilt adjustments can increase annual production by 8-9%. A panel fixed at the optimal winter angle captures 81-88% of the energy compared to full tracking, according to data compiled by solarpaneltilt.com.

But here's what the math doesn't tell you: you're optimizing a smaller slice of the pie. Winter produces maybe 25-30% of your annual total. Squeezing 8% more out of that 25% is about a 2% annual gain. Real, but small.

**Adjust if:**
- You have ground-mounted panels with easy tilt access
- Your mounting hardware was designed for adjustment (some brackets have seasonal notches)
- You're above 45 degrees latitude, where the winter sun angle difference is extreme
- You don't mind doing it four times a year

**Skip it if:**
- Your panels are on a steep roof
- Adjusting means ladders and fall risk
- You're below 35 degrees latitude (the seasonal difference is smaller)
- You'll forget and leave the winter angle on until July (I've done this)

## Solar panels and snow

Snow on your panels blocks light. That's obvious. What's less obvious is how much it matters and how to deal with it.

**Light snow melts fast.** Solar panels are dark, absorb heat, and often sit at an angle. A dusting of snow usually slides off or melts within a day. Panels with a tilt of 35 degrees or steeper shed snow reasonably well on their own.

**Heavy accumulation sticks.** After a major storm, panels at lower angles can stay covered for days. A 6 kW system covered in snow produces zero. If that lasts a week after every storm, the winter losses add up.

**The albedo bonus.** Snow on the ground around your panels acts like a mirror. Fresh snow reflects 80-90% of sunlight. If you have bifacial panels, snow cover on nearby ground can actually boost rear-side production. Some bifacial installations in snowy climates see their best days right after a storm clears, when panels are clean and snow-covered ground is bouncing light everywhere.

**Snow removal tips:**
- Let small amounts melt naturally
- Use a soft foam-head roof rake for heavy accumulation (never metal tools or sharp edges)
- Don't use hot water, as the thermal shock can crack tempered glass
- A steeper tilt angle (40 degrees or more) helps snow slide off before it piles up

One thing I've noticed: the worry about snow usually exceeds the actual losses. In most climates, snow covers panels for a handful of days per winter. The production lost during those days is small relative to the annual total. Unless you're somewhere that gets consistent heavy snowfall with overcast skies for weeks, snow management is not worth obsessing over.

## A winter routine that actually works

My ground-mounted panels have an adjustable tilt. Here's what I actually do, not the theoretical optimum, but what works in practice:

Late October or early November, when the sun starts feeling low, I walk out and steepen the angle. I don't check the calendar. I don't calculate the exact date. The difference between adjusting on October 15 versus November 10 is maybe 1-2% of a month's production. Not worth stressing about.

March or early April, when spring arrives, I flatten them back. Again, approximate timing.

Between adjustments, I'll clear heavy snow with a roof rake when it's convenient. Light dustings I ignore entirely.

SunSeeker sends optional reminders around each solstice and equinox if you want them. Useful if you're the type who forgets (I am). But if the reminders stress you out, turn them off. Set your panels to your latitude and leave them. The annual difference between "optimized seasonal adjustment" and "set it and forget it" is single-digit percentages.

## How much does winter really cost you?

For a typical residential system at 40 degrees latitude:

- **Summer month (June):** 25-30 kWh/day from a 6 kW system
- **Winter month (December):** 10-15 kWh/day from the same system
- **Annual impact:** Winter months (Nov-Feb) produce roughly 25-30% of your yearly total
- **Seasonal adjustment gain:** 5-10% more annual production (about 2-4% if you only count the winter months you're optimizing)

That seasonal gain at $0.15/kWh might be worth $30-60 per year. Worth doing if it's easy. Not worth risking a fall from your roof.

## The bottom line

Solar panels work in winter. They produce less, but they still contribute real power. Cold temperatures help efficiency. Snow is mostly a short-term nuisance. And adjusting your panel angle helps, but the gains are modest enough that you shouldn't feel bad about skipping it.

If you have an easy setup, adjust seasonally. If you don't, set your tilt to your latitude and move on. The panels will keep working either way.
