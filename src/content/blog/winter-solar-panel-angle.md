Every winter, people ask whether they should adjust their solar panels. The sun sits lower in the sky, so a steeper panel angle catches more direct light. Makes sense.

But should you actually climb up there and change it?

## The math

In winter, the sun's highest point is lower than in summer. At 40° latitude, the midwinter sun peaks around 26° above the horizon. In midsummer, it peaks around 73°.

A panel tilted to catch summer sun well will be too flat for winter. Some of the winter light will hit the panel at a shallow angle and lose effectiveness.

The standard winter adjustment: add about 15° to your latitude. At 40° latitude, that means a 55° winter tilt instead of the year-round 40°.

## How much does it actually help?

Seasonal adjustment can increase annual production by 5-10%. Maybe a bit more at high latitudes, a bit less near the equator.

The catch: winter days are also shorter, and weather is often worse. Even with perfect tilt, your winter production will be lower than summer. You're optimizing a smaller slice of the pie.

## When adjusting makes sense

**Yes, adjust if:**
- You have ground-mounted panels with easy access
- Your mounting system is designed for adjustment
- You're at high latitude (above 45°) where winter sun is very low
- You genuinely don't mind doing it four times a year

**Probably skip it if:**
- Your panels are on a steep roof
- Adjusting requires tools or risk of falling
- You're below 35° latitude (smaller seasonal difference)
- You'll forget and leave it at winter angle until July

## What about snow?

Steeper winter angles have a side benefit: snow slides off more easily. Panels at 40°+ shed snow reasonably well. Panels at 25° can stay covered for days.

If you're in a snowy climate, the self-cleaning effect of a steep winter angle might matter more than the tilt optimization itself.

## The app reminder feature

SunSeeker sends optional notifications around each solstice and equinox. If you want to adjust seasonally, the reminders help you remember.

If you don't want to adjust, turn off the reminders and set your panels to your latitude. You're not leaving huge amounts of energy on the table—seasonal adjustment helps but isn't required.

## What I actually do

I have ground-mounted panels with an adjustable tilt. I change the angle twice a year: once in late fall when I notice the sun getting low, and once in spring when I get around to it.

I don't hit the exact optimal dates. It doesn't matter much. The difference between adjusting on December 21st versus "sometime in November when I remember" is marginal.

If your panels are on the roof and adjusting means a ladder, I'd probably set them at latitude and leave them. The gains don't justify the risk or hassle for most people.

## The bottom line

Winter tilt adjustment works. But so does "set it to your latitude and forget it." The difference in annual production is single digits. Do what's practical for your situation.
